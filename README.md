# MTree Upgraded Shaders

Shader graph version of MTree.
MTree is a deprectaed asset from asset store, if you want more information see the [discussion thread](https://discussions.unity.com/t/mtree-tree-creation/713264/870).

**Note:** I would like to include all source files I have, but the license doesn't permit me to upload any of the files. Don't worry I made those shaders by looking at the amplify shader codes.

### How to use the shaders

- Download and move the shader files inside your project, preferably "Shaders" folder in somewhere.
- Change bark and leaf material shaders to "Shader Graphs/BarkShader" and "Shader Graphs/LeafShader".

You will be OK to include in your game and export it. I will make my own version of scripts in my spare time.
